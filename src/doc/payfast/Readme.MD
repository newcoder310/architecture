Problem Statement 1

Startup payment fintech in India, PayFast wants to deploy the payment APIs in cloud. PayFast needs a Solutions Architect to guide them about complete architecture including Network Architecture, Security Architecture, Storage Architecture.

Architecture should focus on below requirements -

High availability: PayFast wants to make sure that their domain name and APIs are highly available.

Scalability : The APIs should be able to scale in and out at runtime as the traffic is not completely predictable. Traffic can spike during evenings and weekends as the payment gateway is used heavily by food delivery apps.

Cost Optimization : Because of the recession, start-up would also need cost-optimized architecture to sustain during these uncertain macroeconomic situations.
Data localization, data residency are important as this is a fintech.

Security : Being a fintech, security is Day 0 priority for PayFast. Underlying infrastructure for the API deployment should be secured. Principle of least privileged should be followed while granting access and permissions management to engineering, devops teams.
Network communications should be secured and appropriate network boundaries should be used to further protect the infrastructure and APIs.

PayFast would like to download updates to libraries from internet. However, this should not compromise security.
